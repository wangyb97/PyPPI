This is a page for background and simple information of PyPPI.

Background
--------------

Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are fundamental to cellular processes and have important
implications for understanding biological mechanisms. Accurate identification of PPIs sites forms the
fundamental basis for subsequent biological research endeavours. Due to the complexity of protein
sequences and the limitations of existing methods, protein characterization and PPIs site identification
still have some difficulty. For instance, many existing predictors either do not incorporate advanced
semantic information for protein characterization or achieve high prediction accuracy. Simultaneously,
the majority of PPIs site predictors function as online servers, employing diverse input formats and
lacking comprehensive documentation. This situation imposes an additional usage challenge for individuals
without coding expertise. The above seems to lack a comprehensive and user-friendly framework that could
address the additional hurdle of non-coders researching PPIs sites.

About PyPPI
--------------

PyPPI provides a total of 6 commonly used datasets and seamlessly integrates feature extraction(based on biological, physicochemical,
protein structure and semantic information), feature selection and sequence prediction modules.
PyPPI also supports visualization and interpretable analysis, which is convenient for biologists to observe the results 
and functions of each module.
